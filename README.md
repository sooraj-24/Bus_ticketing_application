# UniGo

UniGo is an emerging Bus Utility Ticketing System that aims to effectively tackle the recurring issues associated with daily bus ticket bookings on college campuses. It is the one stop solution for all your daily Bus ticket booking needs, where the existing offline system faces numerous challenges like,
- The reliance on offline paper tickets and inconvinient booking timings
- Lengthy queues and long wait times affecting students classes 
- Cash-based transactions only
- Insufficient information about ticket vacancies

The Bus Ticketing System consists of two applications, one for the students and the other one for the conductors. You can access the conductor application here - https://github.com/sooraj-24/Bus_ticketing_app-Conductor

## Features

- A virtual queuing system that operates on a first-come, first-served basis.
- A live ticket booking feature that provides ease of booking as per your convenience.
- A dynamic QR code system, which ensures secure ticket verification in every scenario.
- Centralized information about all campus buses.
